# Deep-Learning
Building different models in a Deep Learning Course I took at Aalto University

**02-mlp**: Built an mlp from scratch in numpy and in pytorch
(Rest in pytorch)
**03-mlp**: Built lenet, vgg, and resnet architectures
**4-reg**: Dabbled in some regularization techniques in dropout, early stopping, noise injection, etc
**05-rnn**: Built an RNN
**06-transformer**: Built a transformer
**07-gnn**: Built a Graph Neural Network
**08-ae**: Built an Autoencoder
**09-gan**: Built Generative Adversarial Networks - DCGAN and WGAN-GP, 
**10-ar**: Built Autoregressive Generative Models - PixelCNN and Conditional PixelCNN
**11-fewshot**: TODO
